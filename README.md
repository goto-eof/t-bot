# T-Bot




**DESCRIPTION**

Single-page application and daemon that allows to retrieve RSS data and send it to a Telegram group/channel through Telegram API. The tbot-web project allows to configure the tbot-daemon through a web application in angular. The java tbot-daemon sends messages in background basing on the configuration set through user interface.


The tbot-web project runs as a simple spring boot application. Currently the software application has been translated into only two languages: English and Italian. Tbot-web was tested on a Linux machine running a local MySQL instance.

**CONFIGURATION**

**DB configuration**

Create a scheme called "tbot", to which the user called "tbot" is associated, with the password "password".

**Maven settings**

Create a user maven settingx.xml file and add and edit the content  [from here](https://github.com/AndreiDodu/t-bot/blob/main/tbot/config-samples/user-maven-settings.xml).


**Upload jar on a remote server**

In eclipses Run configurations add new Maven Build entry that should contain as Goals value install -P uploadToRaspberryPi. In this way we run the maven profile called uploadToRaspberryPi, that will upload, after making a project build, our jar file to the Raspberry PI device.
